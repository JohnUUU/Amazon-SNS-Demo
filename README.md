# Amazon SNS Demo

## How to Run

1. Clone the Repo to your local repository
2. Install the Dependencies

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. `setCredentials()`should set the AWS Config and print it to console and `run()` should print out a list of current topic subscriptions but instead returns a Credentials Missing Error.
